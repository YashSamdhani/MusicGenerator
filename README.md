# MusicGenerator
A Music Generation Model using MAESTRO Dataset

### Abstract
The MAESTRO dataset, a vast collection of classical piano performances in audio and MIDI formats, presents a promising opportunity for advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning in music generation and transcription. This dataset encompasses various compositions by diverse classical composers, including detailed metadata and symbolic annotations. Leveraging the MAESTRO dataset, this study aims to develop a music generator model capable of generating classical piano music that faithfully captures the nuances of the original performances. Additionally, the model aims to explore the synchronisation of audio and symbolic data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricacies of classical piano music.

### Problem Statement
The MAESTRO dataset provides a unique opportunity to delve into the development of a music generation model targeting classical piano compositions. However, several challenges need to be addressed. First, generating expressive and faithful renditions of classical piano music requires converting symbolic data (MIDI) into audio and the reverse process of transcribing audio into symbolic notation. This bidirectional conversion demands the model's ability to capture the intricate details of timing, dynamics, and phrasing inherent in classical piano performances.
