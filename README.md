# MusicGenerator
A Music Generation Model using MAESTRO Dataset

### Abstract
In music generation and transcription, the MAESTRO dataset, a vast collection of classical piano performances in audio and MIDI formats, presents a promising opportunity for advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. This dataset encompasses various compositions by diverse classical composers, including detailed metadata and symbolic annotations. Leveraging the MAESTRO dataset, this research aims to develop a music generator model capable of generating classical piano music that faithfully captures the nuances of the original performances. Additionally, the model aims to explore the synchronisation of audio and symbolic data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricacies of classical piano music.

### Problem Statement
The MAESTRO dataset provides a unique opportunity to delve into the development of a music generation model targeting classical piano compositions. However, several challenges need to be addressed. First, generating expressive and faithful renditions of classical piano music requires converting symbolic data (MIDI) into audio and the reverse process of transcribing audio into symbolic notation. This bidirectional conversion demands the model's ability to capture the intricate details of timing, dynamics, and phrasing inherent in classical piano performances.

Furthermore, the synchronisation of audio and symbolic data presents a complex problem. Accurate alignment between these representations can facilitate transcription, music analysis, and further research. Therefore, the research aims to explore and implement methods that ensure precise synchronisation between audio and symbolic data, enhancing the quality of music transcription.

In summary, this research endeavours to harness the MAESTRO dataset's wealth of classical piano performances to develop a sophisticated music generator model. By tackling the challenge of bidirectional conversion and precise synchronisation, the study seeks to contribute to music generation, transcription, and AI-assisted music analysis, opening avenues for applications in music composition, education, and research.
